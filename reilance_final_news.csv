Without naming Reliance Jio, Broadband India Forum (BIF) said the argument for a 'level playing field' between satellite-based and terrestrial communication services is fundamentally flawed, demonstrating a profound misunderstanding of the technologies and the law. ""In a desperate attempt to confuse all, stakeholders' have questioned the regulator's preference or 'tilting of preference' on the administrative allocation of satellite spectrum, advocating for auctioning such airwaves.

BP in 2011 spent USD 7.2 billion to acquire 30 per cent interest in 23 oil and gas blocks of Reliance. Eastern offshore KG-D6 block was the cornerstone of the deal that also provided for a 10-year exclusivity period which meant that BP would take up energy projects or investments in India only in partnership with Reliance. The firm has so far invested more than USD 12 billion across the energy value chain including bringing on stream three new deepwater natural gas projects in KG-D6 that account for one-third of India's gas production.

Kohli has scored more than 400 runs opening the innings for Royal Challengers Bangalore in this IPL at a strike rate of 133-plus but he has not been able to force the pace of scoring in the middle overs.

08 May 2020,,"8 May 2020 Net D:E Reliance Industries (RIL) Jio Platforms appears to be the new darling of the global investing community. In less than three weeks, on 8 announced a third equity stake sale in Jio Platforms to US-based investment firm Vista Equity Partners. Vista would invest INR113.7b in Jio Platforms for 2.32% equity stake at post-money equity value of INR4.91t (in-line). Once again, this deal reiterates global investors interest in Jio Platforms. Moreover, Jio Platforms is in a sweet spot currently. Further, Jio Platforms has turned virtually debt free through the recent capital reorganization, InvIT structure and now the stake sales. We value Jio Platforms assigning EV/EBITDA multiple of 13x on FY22E to arrive at a target price of INR855/share. RILs announcement states that Vista Equity Partners would invest INR113.7b in Jio Platforms for 2.32% equity stake at post-money equity value of INR4.91t and at enterprise value of INR5.",,,,,Partners,target,announcement,https://trendlyne.com/visitor/loginmodal.html?next=/latest-news/1127/RELIANCE/reliance-industries-ltd/?page=310&qstime=1728896616&querystring_key=next,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

04 May 2020,,"Reliance Industries (RIL) Q4FY20 adjusted result was largely in-line with consensus estimates led by consumer businesses and positive surprise from refinery profit. RIL reported inventory loss of Rs42.5 bn as an exceptional item due to a sharp fall of US$44/bbl in crude oil price during the quarter. Though, higher GRM of US$8.9/bbl vs consensus estimate of US$7.5/bbl and robust 49% YoY growth in Digital Services EBITDA was a positive surprise. The company expects Rs1.05 tr of cash inflow during CY20 led by Right Issue proceedings (1:15 ratio at a price of Rs1,257), Facebook deal (to be completed by Q1FY21) and BP deal, which would help achieving its target of zero-netdebt by year end.

While the stake sale is expected to fetch INR436b, the company is creating a separate O2C business and is looking forward to another transaction of a similar magnitude. business EBITDA came in line with our estimate of INR218b (+5% YoY), primarily led by better performance of the Digital and Retail segments. However, higher depreciation and interest cost led to a miss on PBT (before exceptional expense) to INR135b (13% miss, -2% YoY). The company recognized exceptional expense of INR42.7b, primarily as non-cash inventory loss in the O2C business (with ~INR0.2b toward other liabilities and AGR dues reversal). Reported PAT came in at INR66b (-37% YoY). Adj. PAT was 8% lower YoY to INR96b (20% miss).",,,,,,,,https://trendlyne.com/visitor/loginmodal.html?next=/latest-news/1127/RELIANCE/reliance-industries-ltd/?page=312&qstime=1728896616&querystring_key=next,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

06 Dec 2019,,"Assuming Rs25-30 hike in ARPU, it translates to incremental EBIDTA of Rs85100bn. Reliance JIO has launched All-in-One Plans' with higher tariffs following hikes by Vodafone and Airtel. After three years of severe tariff war, price hikes are welcome and we expect further hikes going forward.

05 Dec 2019,,"High ARPU prepaid plans have seen ~27% price hike, which would result in ARPU increasing by INR38 from INR142 to INR180. While no rates have been disclosed for low ARPU Jio feature phone subscribers, we assume ~30% price hikes for these subscribers too. Low ARPU Jio phone subscribers would probably see a hike of INR25 in ARPUs from INR84 to INR109. The price differential between RJio and Bharti/VILs price plans is constant at ~INR40-50 for most of the popular quarterly bundled plans; however, we see the discount of RJios plan over Bharti/VIL reducing to ~8% from ~11-13% witnessed in the previous months. The hike in ARPUs should result in ~INR134b/INR119b incremental revenue/ EBITDA, which is ~25%/58% rise over the previous revenue/ EBITDA (2QFY20 annualized) with 89% incremental EBITDA. This is on the back of INR100b interest cost, which should be contained due to the recent capital reorganization announcements and reducing capex intensity in the market as indicated by RJio and other telcos.",,,,,hike,hike,result,https://trendlyne.com/visitor/loginmodal.html?next=/latest-news/1127/RELIANCE/reliance-industries-ltd/?page=337&qstime=1728896616&querystring_key=next,,,,,,,,,,,revenue,EBITDA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This was partially offset by the lackluster performance from Petrochemicals (-11.9% YoY; ~19.0% of revenue) and Refining segment (-1.6% YoY; ~47.9% of revenue) due to unplanned outages, continued effect of trade tensions and raw material price volatility.

Increase in revenue is primarily on account of robust growth in Retail & Digital Services businesses which grew by 27% and 43%, respectively.

Exports (including deemed exports) from RIL's India operations were lower by 12.1% at Rs 53,161 crore as against Rs 60,460 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year primarily due to lower price realization for refining and petrochemical products and emphasis in domestic placement....",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In our view, investors should look beyond the debt reduction and focus on incremental monetization options for the business tariff hikes and/or ancillary revenues. Jios 4QFY19 was marginally weak. To abate investors concerns of persistent capex, cash burn and rising debt, Jio/RIL finally re-engineered its BS with transfer of fiber and tower assets to SPVs majority owned by InvITs.

18 Jan 2019,,"Our SOTP-based target for RIL is Rs 1,331/sh based on Dec-20 earnings (6.5x EV/e for standalone refining, 9x EV/e for petchem, Rs 6.0/sh for domestic E&P, 1x EV/invested capital for Shale, 20x EV/e for Retail and 10x EV/e for Telecom. Maintain BUY In 3QFY19, RIL proved itself yet again largely owing to better petchem margins and volumes, despite weaker GRMs. Petchem EBIT/kg stood at Rs 20.7/kg, up 16.3% YoY. This expansion of margins was owing to a better product mix and use of US ethane/refinery off-gases as a feedstock. Petchem production volumes were up 21.3% YoY to 9.7mmt, with the refinery off gas cracker (ROGC) ramping up. The performance of the refining segment was subdued. GRM was USD 8.8/bbl owing to volatility in crude oil prices, and weak light distillates spread.

18 Jan 2019,,We value RJio at 10x Dec-20E EV/EBITDA at an EV of Rs 3.18tn (Rs 537/sh of RIL). Reliance Jios (RJio) 3QFY19 operating performance was in-line. Subs/Revenue/EBITDA/APAT grew by 11/12.4/13.3/22% QoQ. Interest and depreciation continue to puzzle with modest rise of 10/9.5% QoQ. This is inspite of steep rise in usage. Jios consumer engagement (voice/data usage/sub) is healthy and steadily inching upward despite substantial subscriber addition on low-ARPU JioPhone2. RIL is swiftly strengthening its business and consumer propositions with investments in media/technology companies and through content deals. This bodes well from the strategic perspective.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because there is a nugget buried below all the subscriber increases Jio boasts about - incumbents have retained market share in metros, and Jio's growth is coming from the small towns.

The company has already brought down the overall average revenue per user (ARPU) of the telecom industry from over Rs 159 to Rs 104.
